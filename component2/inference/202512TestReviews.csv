2025-12,ampara,google_maps,"Ravana's Cave is one of those places where the legend is far more captivating than the actual site itself. Tucked away in the hills near Ella, it’s steeped in the ancient lore of the Ramayana, believed to be one of the hideouts where King Ravana kept Princess Sita captive. This mythological connection is what drew me in, offering a chance to walk through a piece of living history.
The adventure begins with a moderately challenging climb—around 650 to 700 steps that wind steeply up through a lush, green forest. The ascent is shaded, which helps with the heat, and you get some genuinely beautiful views of the valley and Little Adam's Peak across the way on your trek up. It's a solid little workout, filled with natural beauty and the chance to spot some local wildlife like monkeys and exotic birds.
However, the ""cave"" at the top is a bit underwhelming. It's essentially a large, dark opening in the rock face, and you can only go a short distance inside before a barricade stops you. It’s very dark, damp, and home to many bats, and there is virtually no historical information provided on-site. Most visitors, myself included, find the journey and the surrounding natural views more rewarding than the cave itself. It's a quick stop—about an hour round trip—and best for those who really appreciate the mythology and enjoy a short, steep hike, rather than a significant landmark or panoramic viewpoint. Be sure to bring a torch for the inside of the cave!",2025-12-15T12:54:31+00:00,0.9694284271244025,positive

On November 21st 2025, thirteen of us travelling with Flamingo Lanka visited the sacred Ruwanweliseya stupa.  This remarkable hemispherical monument, originally constructed in 140 BC by king Dutugemunu, stands as one of the tallest ancient structures in the world at a height of 103 metres, with a circumference of 290 metres and housing and enshrines a large amount of Buddha’s relics within.  Although king Dutugemunu commenced its construction, it was completed after he passed away.

The Ruwanweliseya, constructed primarily of brick, is a marvel of ancient engineering.  The sheer volume of bricks required for its construction is staggering.  Its iconic white appearance is maintained by periodic painting of the outer plaster.  It is a living shrine that had been drawing pilgrims and awe-struck visitors for centuries!

During our visit there, we joined the many devotees venerating and worshipping the stupa.  As is customary at religious sites, visitors are required to dress modestly and remove their footwear before entry.

2025-12,colombo,google_maps,"A racist, a scammer, and an abuser of power who forcibly detained me🤢

I am writing this complaint with great anger regarding what happened to me tonight (Dec 9, around 7:44 PM) at your Asian restaurant. I am a regular customer who has brought many friends here, but today I was treated like a criminal by your waiter Robin (photo attached).

1. Harassment and Detention

While I was eating, Robin kept aggressively demanding payment. I refused to give him cash at the table because he was acting so shady that I suspected he wanted to pocket the money himself.

Because I wouldn't pay him cash directly, he blocked me and refused to let me leave for 10 minutes. He only let me go downstairs to the cashier after I screamed that I would call the police.

2. Public Humiliation

This scene caused a huge commotion. Many other Chinese guests gathered to watch me being detained. This was incredibly humiliating and has damaged my reputation in front of my community.

3. The Scam

At the cashier, I handed over 10,000 LKR specifically to buy chips. Robin tricked the cashier into charging me 7,500 LKR for a buffet instead. I never agreed to this charge. I wanted chips. I was scammed.

4. Racism

I believe Robin targeted me specifically because I am Chinese. The manager on duty did nothing to help and covered up for him.

I demand a refund of my 7,500 LKR in chips and an investigation into Robin immediately.

If you do not fix this, I will post the full story of this racism and scam on all Chinese social media platforms. Please wait and see, the result will come very soon.

On top of that, Robin actually tried to physically snatch my payment receipt and my mobile phone from my hands. I felt genuinely threatened and scared.

Is this behavior allowed in your employee handbook? Snatching a proof of payment from a customer? Oh my god, this is absolutely insane.

I will definitely be filing a formal report about this to the Sri Lankan government authorities!!!!!!!!!!",2025-12-09T16:48:34+00:00,0.4270156035848516,neutral

2. Charges cannot be justified & it is way too high for that shoddy arrangement which they claim a 3-star hotel.
3. No responsible officer on the property to take care of the guests in case of emergency situation during after hours, let aside an operational front desk.
4. No telephone/ intercom system. Only an unconnected CDMA telephone was in the rooms. Only God knows how to communicate using that.
5. Cannot safely access dining area which is an open space, & you are compelled to brave all risks of security and weather in getting there.
6. All cutlery continued to be laid full time, even during the night till next day’s breakfast. Unsuspecting diners use those without knowing which rat or raccoon licked or rubbed their genitalia on those.
7. No loading/unloading area.
8. No disabled access.
9. No covered access to rooms. Hell on earth when raining.

2025-12,trincomalee,google_maps,"Thirukoneswaram Kovil in Trincomalee, also known as the Temple of a Thousand Pillars, is one of the most revered Hindu temples in Sri Lanka and holds a prominent place in Ramayana legend. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is believed to be linked to Ravana and his devotion to Shiva. Thirukoneswaram is often referred to as the Dakshina Kailasa (Southern Kailash) and is revered for its spiritual energy and significance in Shaivism.

According to local lore, Ravana was a devout follower of Lord Shiva, and it’s said that he visited the Thirukoneswaram temple to offer prayers and seek blessings. The Yuddha Kanda of the Ramayana speaks of Ravana’s worship of Shiva, but it doesn’t specify the location. In Sri Lankan tradition, Thirukoneswaram is considered one of the places where Ravana’s deep devotion to Shiva was evident.

It is believed that Ravana installed a lingam (a representation of Shiva) at Thirukoneswaram as part of his devotion. According to Sri Lankan lore, he would come here to perform rituals and pray for strength, which was part of his effort to gain divine protection and powers. Some legends even suggest that he meditated here, hoping to obtain boons from Shiva to fortify his strength for battles.

Another legend holds that after defeating Ravana, Rama himself visited Thirukoneswaram to atone for the sin of killing Ravana, who, despite his wrongdoings, was a Brahmin and a devotee of Shiva. This belief aligns with the tradition that Rama traveled to several Shiva temples to cleanse himself of the “Brahmahatya dosha” (the sin of killing a Brahmin).",2025-12-14T17:34:56+00:00,0.925985440608152,positive
